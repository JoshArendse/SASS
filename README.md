## Setting up your Workspace

-step 1: Download ruby command editor for windows if you dont have it already at https://rubyinstaller.org/.

-step 2: Install sass using command "gem install sass".

-step 3: After you have created a project folder with your folder structure go onto the terminal and start command "sass --watch scss:css"
        this will link the scss file to your css file. That way any edits done in scss will change in css
